# Object-Oriented-Programming-Calculator-Java-Project

## Introduction
Project approach study is the natural way to present technology in an attractive manner. Initially, young students have limited knowledge and experience in design or construction of a product. We develop a calculator, this calculator is helpful to do simple arithmetic operations. It is easy to develop and easy to use. A calculator is an electronic device which is used to solve mathematics problems which are being faced by us in our daily life. Most of the calculators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Some also do square root moreover complex calculator can help us to draw functional graph. There many different ways to solve mathematical problems using the calculator.

## Project Motivation and Objectives
* To implement basic mathematical operations. 
* To create a user-friendly interface. 
* To understand event handling in Java Swing.
* Simple yet practical application. 
* Good for learning basic GUI and event handling.
